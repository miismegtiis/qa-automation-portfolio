# QA Automation Portfolio – Kamilla Hegyi

This repository contains my automation testing practice projects
using Python and Selenium.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
- understanding of basic automation testing concepts
- structured test organization
- clean and readable test scripts
- ability to work with Git and version control

The test projects are based on practice web applications,
including training environments and a school-developed hotel booking application.

All examples are for educational purposes.
